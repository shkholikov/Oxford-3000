# 📖 Oxford 3000 Wordlist
 
### 🧐 What is Oxford 3000 wordlist?
If you know 2500-3000 words, you will be able to understand 80% of the language used in business and everyday communication. The remaining 20% can be inferred from context. That’s why it’s important to know the most commonly used words to speed up your language learning journey and to become fluent faster. Oxford composed a list of 3000 most common words in the English language that are necessary to know in order to communicate fluently. By the way, to reach the Upper-Intermediate level, you need to learn at least 3000 words!

### 🤓 Why this app? 
This application contains all these 3000 words in a table inside. The data is stored in a real-time Google Firebase database. So you can use the app by cloning it to your own repository. The only thing you need to do is upload the new oxford-worlidlist.json to your own Firebase realtime database (if you want to use your own database).
